								<h3>Hi, I'm Jack Swygman!</h3>
								<p>I a licensed CPA in Georgia and Texas and my specialty is in partnering with businesses to grow with them and transform your small business in the following 2 ways:<br><br>
									1. Transform your accounting and bookkeeping from being a required annoyance to the numeric blueprint for your increased profits and greater impact<br><br>
									2. Transform your tax world from being a last minute tax preparation hassle to having a full <i>tax strategy</i>, being 10 steps ahead of the IRS at all times.<br><br>
									I am the owner of Swygman Advisory and my passion is working together with small business owners to transform the small business landscape to serve our families and communities, rather than the other way around. </p>

								<p>I spent 7 years in a national public accounting firm working with larger businesses and nonprofit organizations. Big business, with its excess cash and plethora of processes, procedures, governance, and HR complexity, left me feeling disconnected from the way the everyday business owner experiences life and business. I am here to bring my background of working with larger businesses to serve the small business world, and hopefully touch some grass along the way, with the goal of forming <b>enduring partnerships</b> with my clients.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Not Your Average CPA Firm</h4>
								<p>At Swygman Advisory, our emphasis is on forming an <b>enduring partnership</b> with each and every one of our clients. What does this mean? We are not a tax and accounting mill that works with every client that walks through our door. We spend time on the front end discerning if a relationship between us and our prospect can truly result in an <b>enduring partnership</b>, because we wouldn't have it any other way. We have only one way we want to serve you, with total attention, trust, and time. After all, you don't treat your business like a checklist to be completed, why should we?</p>

								<p>To achieve our goal of forming <b>enduring partnerships</b>, we live and breath our four core values:</p>
